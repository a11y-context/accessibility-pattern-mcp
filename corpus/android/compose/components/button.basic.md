# Button

Pattern ID: `button.basic`

Control that triggers an immediate action. Covers text, icon-only, floating, and action-chip presentations, which share one role and differ in where the accessible name comes from.

## Use When
- Use when the user triggers an immediate action and stays on the current screen (e.g., "Save", "Add to Watchlist", "Play").
- Use when the action is presented as a floating action button, an icon-only control, or an assist or suggestion chip. All four carry `Role.Button` and no state of their own.

## Do Not Use When
- Do not use when the control represents an on or off state that persists after the tap (use `button.toggle`).
- Do not use when the control carries a `selected` state, such as a filter or a removable token (use `chip.filter` or `chip.input`).
- Do not use when the control opens a list of commands (use `menu.basic`).
- Do not use when the control opens a URL or leaves the app (use `link.standalone`).
- Do not use when the control is a row in a list that navigates elsewhere (use `list-item.basic`).

## Must Haves
- The control reports `Role.Button` and a click action. Material's `Button`, `IconButton`, `FloatingActionButton`, `AssistChip`, and `SuggestionChip` are the reference implementations across the presentations this pattern covers; anything else has to set both itself (`global.native-first`).
- The button has an accessible name that describes its purpose or action.
- When the button has visible text, that text serves as the accessible name and no `contentDescription` is set on it.
- An icon-only control takes its name from `contentDescription` on the control, and the `Icon` inside it carries `contentDescription = null`.
- When several buttons on one screen share visible text, such as a repeated "Edit" per row, give each a `contentDescription` that names what it acts on (e.g., "Edit username").
- When an `ExtendedFloatingActionButton` collapses to icon-only, set a `contentDescription` that survives the collapse. The visible text is the name while expanded and disappears while collapsed, so a control named only by its text becomes unnamed.
- Set `onClickLabel` when "Double tap to activate" would not tell the user what happens (e.g., `onClickLabel = "add to watchlist"`). This is the only supplementary text Compose exposes, and it completes the sentence TalkBack speaks.
  - `IconButton` and the other Material composables here take no `onClickLabel` parameter. Set the label through `Modifier.semantics { onClick(label = "...", action = null) }`.
- If the action is unavailable, pass `enabled = false` rather than removing the handler, so the control stays in the accessibility tree and reports that it is disabled.
- Give a `FloatingActionButton` a `traversalIndex` or a containing traversal group when it is drawn last but read first, because it sits outside the content flow and composition order will not match what the user sees (`global.traversal-order`).
- Meets the touch target baseline in `global_rules.md` (`global.touch-target-size`).
- Meets the focus states baseline in `global_rules.md` (`global.focus-states`).

## Don'ts
- Do not build a button from `Row`, `Box`, or `Image` with `Modifier.clickable` when a Material composable exists. It renders identically and exposes no role, so TalkBack announces content with no indication it can be activated.
- Do not include the word "button" in `contentDescription`. TalkBack appends the role itself, so the control announces "Save button, button".
- Do not set `contentDescription` on the `Icon` inside a labeled button. The button's own name and the icon's name both reach the merged node, and the control announces twice.
- Do not put the result of the action in `contentDescription` when it belongs in `onClickLabel`. The name says what the control is; the click label says what activating it does.
- Do not pass a lambda to `onClick`'s `action` parameter to attach a label on a component like `IconButton` that takes no `onClickLabel` directly. The parameter replaces the control's click action in the accessibility tree, so TalkBack triggers the lambda instead of the real handler and the button does nothing, while touch input bypasses semantics and still triggers the real action. Pass `action = null` to attach the label without replacing the handler.
- Do not disable a button by removing its `onClick` or wrapping it in a non-clickable container. Both leave a control that looks disabled and reports nothing, and the second silently drops the 48dp minimum that the Material composable applies only while it owns the callback.

## Customizable
- Any of the five button skins, `Button`, `ElevatedButton`, `FilledTonalButton`, `OutlinedButton`, and `TextButton`, is acceptable. They share one role and one set of semantics and differ only in container and elevation tokens.
- The same holds within each family: the four `IconButton` skins are interchangeable, as are the three `FloatingActionButton` sizes, and `AssistChip` and `SuggestionChip` differ by usage convention rather than by exposed semantics.
- `onClickLabel` is optional. Add it when the action's outcome is not obvious from the name, and omit it when the name already says what happens ("Save", "Delete").

## Golden Pattern

Structural reference for AI coding assistants — semantics, focus, and keyboard behavior. Styling, copy, and demo data are illustrative.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ButtonExamples() {
    // Text-only. The visible text is the accessible name; set nothing else.
    Button(onClick = { /* save */ }) {
        Text("Save")
    }

    // Icon plus text. The text names the control, so the icon is decorative.
    Button(onClick = { /* download */ }) {
        Icon(Icons.Filled.Download, contentDescription = null)
        Text("Download")
    }

    // Icon-only. The name moves to the control, and onClickLabel says what happens.
    IconButton(
        onClick = { /* open settings */ },
        modifier = Modifier.semantics { onClick(label = "open settings", action = null) }
    ) {
        Icon(Icons.Filled.Settings, contentDescription = "Settings")
    }

    // Repeated control. The row's subject goes in the name, or every row reads alike.
    IconButton(onClick = { /* edit */ }) {
        Icon(Icons.Filled.Edit, contentDescription = "Edit username")
    }

    // Extended FAB. The text is the name while expanded and gone while collapsed,
    // so the contentDescription is what survives.
    ExtendedFloatingActionButton(
        onClick = { /* compose */ },
        expanded = false,
        icon = { Icon(Icons.Filled.Add, contentDescription = null) },
        text = { Text("New list") },
        modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = "New list" }
    )

    // Assist chip. Role.Button, no selected state; a chip only in appearance.
    AssistChip(
        onClick = { /* filter by genre */ },
        label = { Text("Comedy") }
    )

    // Disabled. enabled = false keeps it in the tree and reports the state.
    Button(onClick = { /* never fires */ }, enabled = false) {
        Text("Submit")
    }
}
```
