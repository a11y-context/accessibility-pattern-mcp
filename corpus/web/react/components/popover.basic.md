# Popover

Pattern ID: `popover.basic`

A non-modal overlay anchored to its trigger; uses `role="dialog"` with an accessible name, moves focus in on open and restores it on close, but does not trap focus or `inert` the background.

The non-modal counterpart to `dialog.basic`. The defining contrast is the absence of background isolation and focus trapping: the page stays interactive while the popover is open.

## Use When
- Use when an overlay anchored to a trigger presents content or a task without blocking the page (e.g., an editor popover, a composer, a rich panel with interactive controls).
- Use when the user can keep interacting with the rest of the page while the overlay is open.
- Use when focus should move into the overlay on open but not be trapped there.

## Do Not Use When
- Do not use when the user must complete or dismiss the overlay before returning to the page (use `dialog.basic`).
- Do not use when a control simply shows and hides inline content (use `disclosure.basic`).
- Do not use when the overlay is a menu of commands (use `menu.basic`).
- Do not use when the message is a brief, non-interactive status update (use `toast.basic`).
- Do not use when the content is a plain-text supplementary hint (use `tooltip.basic`).

## Must Haves
- The popover surface uses `role="dialog"`, or a native `<dialog>` element shown non-modally (rendered in the DOM or opened with `.show()`, never `.showModal()`).
- The popover has an accessible name via `aria-labelledby` (preferred), referencing a visible title element (e.g., `<h2 id="...">`), or `aria-label`.
- Focus moves into the popover on open, landing on the popover container or its first interactive control.
- Esc closes the popover, regardless of where focus currently sits, since focus is not trapped and may have moved into the page.
- Focus is restored to the invoking element on close.
  - Capture the invoking element at open time, and restore focus with `requestAnimationFrame` after the popover is unmounted.
- The popover does not trap focus. Tab and Shift+Tab move out of the popover into the rest of the page, which stays interactive.
- The popover does not set `aria-modal="true"` and does not apply `inert` to the background.
- Provide a visible close control. Use a native `<button>` (preferred), or `role="button"` only when a native button cannot be used.
  - If `role="button"` is used instead of a native `<button>`, add `tabindex="0"` and keyboard support for Enter and Space, ensuring Space prevents page scrolling while activating the control.
- The close control has an accessible name that describes its purpose or action (e.g., `aria-label="Close"`).
- Ensure a visible focus state (e.g., a 2px solid outline offset by 1-2px) around the trigger, the close control, and any focusable content within the popover.

## Don'ts
- Do not set `aria-modal="true"` on a popover; it falsely tells assistive technology the background is inert.
- Do not trap focus within the popover.
- Do not apply `inert` to, or otherwise block, the background content.
- Do not omit focus restoration; closing the popover must return focus to the element that invoked it.
- Do not bind Esc only to a container-level handler on the popover surface; once focus leaves the untrapped popover, that handler stops firing and Esc no longer closes.

## Customizable
- Delivery is at the engineer's discretion as long as the non-modal contract above holds. Acceptable options:
  - A native `<dialog>` element shown non-modally.
  - The `popover` attribute, which adds light dismiss on outside click and Esc for free.
  - A `<div role="dialog">` with explicit positioning.
- Positioning is at the engineer's discretion. A popover is normally anchored to its trigger (CSS anchor positioning, the `popover` attribute's anchoring, or a positioning library), but a fixed-position panel is acceptable as long as the relationship to the trigger stays clear and focus still moves in on open.
- Whether an outside click also dismisses the popover is optional. The `popover` attribute provides it automatically; a `role="dialog"` div may add it via an outside-pointer handler, or omit it.
- Initial focus may land on the popover container (`tabindex="-1"`) so the accessible name is announced before the user Tabs to the first control, or on the first interactive control when the user's next action is to type or select. Either is acceptable.

## Golden Pattern

Structural reference for AI coding assistants — semantics, focus, and keyboard behavior. Styling, copy, and demo data are illustrative.

```jsx
"use client";

export function Popover() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const openerRef = useRef(null);
  const popoverRef = useRef(null);
  const titleId = useId();

  const openPopover = () => {
    // Capture the opener at the moment we open, so focus can be restored on close.
    openerRef.current = document.activeElement;
    setOpen(true);
  };

  const closePopover = () => {
    setOpen(false);
    // Defer until the popover has unmounted and the opener is focusable again.
    const opener = openerRef.current;
    requestAnimationFrame(() => opener?.focus());
  };

  // Move focus into the popover on open. No focus trap: Tab leaves the popover
  // into the rest of the page, which stays interactive (no inert, no aria-modal).
  useEffect(() => {
    if (open) popoverRef.current?.focus();
  }, [open]);

  // Esc must close from anywhere, because focus is not trapped and may sit in
  // the page. A container-level onKeyDown would miss those keystrokes, so bind
  // Esc at the document level while open.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!open) return;
    const onKeyDown = (e) => {
      if (e.key === "Escape") closePopover();
    };
    document.addEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
    return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
  }, [open]);
