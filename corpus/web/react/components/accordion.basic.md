# Accordion

Pattern ID: `accordion.basic`

A set of show/hide sections with heading-wrapped buttons controlling associated panels via `aria-expanded` (and optionally `aria-controls` / region).

## Use When
- Use when content can be organized into collapsible sections to reduce scanning and scrolling.

## Do Not Use When
- Do not use when content must be visible for comparison or comprehension (use static, non-collapsing sections instead).

## Must Haves
- Accordion is composed of a series of header + panel pairs.
- Each accordion header control is a native `<button>` (or `role="button"` only when a native button cannot be used).
  - If role="button" is used instead of a native `<button>`, add `tabindex="0"` and keyboard support for Enter and Space, ensuring Space prevents page scrolling while activating the control.
- Each header button is contained within a heading element (`<h2>`–`<h6>`) or an element with `role="heading"` and the appropriate `aria-level`.
- The header button uses `aria-expanded="true"` when its panel is visible and `"false"` when hidden.
- The panel is shown/hidden in the DOM (e.g., via the `hidden` attribute), so that hidden content cannot be accessed by screen readers.
- Users move focus between accordion headers using Tab / Shift+Tab.
- Since the header control is a button, it is activated with Enter or Space.
- If the accordion does not permit a panel to be collapsed while expanded, the expanded header button uses `aria-disabled="true"` (rare case).
- Ensure a visible focus state (e.g., a 2px solid outline offset by 1-2px) around the header controls.

## Customizable
- `aria-controls` on the header button pointing to the panel ID (recommended, but optional).
- Panel container uses `role="region"` with `aria-labelledby` referencing the header button ID (optional).
  - Avoid `role="region"` when it would create landmark proliferation (e.g., many panels can be expanded at once, especially > ~6).
  - Prefer `role="region"` when panels contain headings.
- Whether multiple panels can be expanded at the same time.
  - If only one panel may be expanded, expanding a new panel collapses the previously open panel.
- The heading level will usually be `h2`, but this is customizable and depends on the heading hierarchy of the surrounding page.

## Don'ts
- Do not use non-focusable headers (e.g., `<div>` without proper button semantics) as the interactive control.
- Do not make the panel visible while leaving `aria-expanded="false"` (and vice versa).
- Do not remove panel content from the DOM in a way that breaks expected focus behavior (e.g., collapsing a panel while focus remains inside it without moving focus).
- Do not use `role="heading"` without an `aria-level`.
- Do not nest accordions within accordion panels.

```jsx
"use client";

export function AccordionDemo() {

  const [openId, setOpenId] = useState("overview");

  function toggle(id) {
    setOpenId(id);
  }

  const overviewOpen = openId === "overview";
  const detailsOpen = openId === "details";
  const shippingOpen = openId === "shipping";

  return (
    <div>
      {/* h3 assumes an h2 section heading exists above the accordion.
          Match the heading level to the surrounding page hierarchy
          (see Customizable). */}
