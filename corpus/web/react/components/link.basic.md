# Link

Pattern ID: `link.basic`

Native link for navigation using `<a href>`. Supports optional context in the accessible name, including "opens in new tab/window/dialog".

## Use When
- Use when activating the element navigates to a different URL, route, or in-page anchor.
- Use when the primary purpose of the element is destination-based navigation rather than performing an action.

## Do Not Use When
- Do not use when activating the element performs an in-place action such as submitting, saving, deleting, toggling, or opening a dialog (use `button.basic`).
- Do not use when the element changes UI state without navigation (use `button.basic`).

## Must Haves
- Use a native `<a>` element with an `href` whenever possible.
- Ensure the link's purpose/destination is understandable from the link text alone, or from the link text plus programmatically determined context (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, offscreen text).
- The link has an accessible name that describes its purpose or destination.
- When the link has visible text, the visible text serves as the accessible name.
- When additional context is needed beyond the visible text, add it via `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, or offscreen text. The visible text appears at the start of the accessible name.
- For icon-only links, provide an accessible name using `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Icons within links must be decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`).
- Keyboard activation must follow native link behavior: Enter activates; Space does not.
- Ensure the link is focusable:
  - Preferred: provide `href` (native focus + native behaviors).
  - If using `role="link"` on a non-`<a>` element, you must also provide keyboard support and focus management (e.g., `tabIndex="0"` and Enter key activation).
- If a link opens a new tab/window, include both:
  - programmatic context in the accessible name (e.g., "opens in new tab"), and
  - a visual affordance: append an external-link icon at the end of the visible label.
 - Ensure a visible focus state (e.g., a 2px solid outline offset by 1-2px) around the link.

## Customizable
- No accessibility-relevant variations beyond the Must Haves above.

## Don'ts
- Do not style a link to look like plain text when it appears inline within a paragraph; inline links must be visually obvious (e.g., underlined).
- Do not rely on color alone to indicate a link.
- Do not use `<a>` without `href` for interactive behavior; it loses native link semantics and behaviors.
- Do not use `role="link"` on non-link elements unless you cannot use a native `<a href>`. Native links provide browser behaviors ARIA cannot add automatically.
  - Do not use `role="link"` unless you also implement the missing link behaviors (focus, Enter activation, navigation, and expected link affordances).
- Do not permit Space to activate links.

```jsx
export function LinkDemo() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Simple link: accessible name from visible text */}
      <a href="/account">Sign in</a>

      <br />

      {/* Add context when needed (e.g., repeated links) */}
      <h3 id="prod-1">Superflo Water Bottle</h3>
      <a href="/products/1" aria-labelledby="prod-1-link prod-1">
        <span id="prod-1-link">Read more</span>
      </a>

      <br />

      {/* Opens in new tab: add accessible context + visible external icon */}
      <a
        href="https://example.com/report.pdf"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        aria-label="Download report, opens in a new tab"
      >
        Download report <span aria-hidden="true">[external-link-icon]</span>
      </a>

      <br />

      {/* Icon-only link: must provide an accessible name */}
      <a href="/settings" aria-label="Settings">
        <span aria-hidden="true">[icon]</span>
      </a>
    </div>
  );
}
```
